== Reports

=== Build Artifacts
After running build with `Smart testing` Maven extension installed, It's quite cumbersome to look entire logs
to identify which tests are selected to run? How tests are ordered? The selected tests are belongs to which strategy? What are properties
used to configure smart testing?

To overcome this `Smart testing` is providing report in `XML` format.

`Smart testing` report will give you details about usageMode, different strategies configured to run
tests, all other properties related to smart testing, Test Selection with different strategies etc.

=== How to Configure?
By default this feature is disabled. You can enable it by setting property `smart.testing.report.enable` to `true`.

You will get generated reports in `target/smart-testing-report.xml` by default.

To change the location of the generated output report, following properties
should be set to the desired alternative location.

`smart.testing.report.dir`:: To configure dir location to put generated reports.
`smart.testing.report.name`:: To configure the file name of the generated report.

=== Sample Report

Hereâ€™s how the sample report looks like:

[source, xml, indent=0]

include::../core/src/test/resources/sample-report.xml[]
