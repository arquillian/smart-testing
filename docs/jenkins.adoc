== Jenkins

So far you've seen how to use Smart Testing from developer perspective (running on local machine).
But ultimately your software is going to be built on CI/CD server and saving time there means more resources for other projects.

One of important things to take into consideration is that meanwhile on the developer's machine `selecting` mode might be the one used most frequently, in CI/CD environment you *should* consider executing the build in the `ordering` mode at some point (let it be regular build or a step in the pipeline). You can read more about modes at <<Modes>> section.

In case of development machine, you'll probably want to build simply against the local changes, but in case of CI/CD environment, probably the changes you want to take into consideration are those between the commits you are going to run the build.

Let's see how to configure Smart Testing in Jenkins.

=== Jenkins Freestyle project

Freestyle project is the most basic way of creating builds with Jenkins.

To use Smart Testing in this kind of project, you only need to create a build step of kind `Execute Shell`/`Execute Windows batch command` running Maven with required Smart Testing configuration parameters.


[source, subs="attributes, macros"]
----
mvn -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/configuration/Configuration.java[name="SMART_TESTING"]="new, affected"
    -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/configuration/Configuration.java[name="SMART_TESTING_MODE"]=ordering
    -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/scm/ScmRunnerProperties.java[name="SCM_RANGE_HEAD"]=${GIT_COMMIT}
    -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/scm/ScmRunnerProperties.java[name="SCM_RANGE_TAIL"]=${GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT}
    test
----

On the next figure you can see the step configuration.

.Freestyle Execute Shell Configuration

After setting this up you are ready to run the build.

What you will notice in this case is that since the configured mode is `ordering`, all tests are going to be executed, but the ones marked as important by `new` and `affected` strategies are executed first.

=== Jenkins Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline is a group of plugins which support implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is typically written into a text file (called a `Jenkinsfile`) which in turn is checked into a projectâ€™s source control repository

To run Smart Testing in Jenkins Pipeline you need to manually call `checkout scm` process to get access to `GIT_COMMIT` and `PREVIOUS_GIT_COMMIT` variables.

This might not be a problem if you are using scripted pipeline but in case of using declarative pipeline, since the checkout process is done automatically. you have no access to `GIT_COMMIT` and `PREVIOUS_GIT_COMMIT` variables.

So in next snippet you can see an example of how to use declarative pipeline with Smart Testing:

[source, subs="macros"]
.Jenkinsfile
----
pipeline {
    options {
        skipDefaultCheckout()
    }
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Compile and Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def scmVars = checkout scm
                    sh "mvn -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/configuration/Configuration.java[name="SMART_TESTING"]='new, affected' -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/configuration/Configuration.java[name="SMART_TESTING_MODE"]=ordering -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/scm/ScmRunnerProperties.java[name="SCM_RANGE_HEAD"]=${scmVars.GIT_COMMIT} -Dconst:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/scm/ScmRunnerProperties.java[name="SCM_RANGE_TAIL"]=${scmVars.GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT} test"
                }
            }
            post {
                success {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/**/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

There are few important things you have to keep in mind when adjusting your `Jenkinsfile` if you are using declarative script approach.

First of all you need to disable automatic checkout. Then you need to manually call checkout and store the result into  a variable. Finally you can call Maven, getting Git parameters from `scmVars`.
