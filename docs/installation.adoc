== Installation

=== Maven Extension

*Smart Testing* is a Maven extension, so needs to be installed as is.

==== Maven >= 3.1.X

Get Smart Testing _shaded_ copy from https://bintray.com/arquillian/Arquillian/smart-testing[Bintray] and copy it to `M2_HOME/lib/ext`

==== Maven >= 3.3.X

You can still use the process described at <<Maven >= 3.1.X>> or use the new _core extension configuration mechanism_ by
creating folder called `.mvn` in the root of your project and create inside it an `extensions.xml` file
which registers the smart testing extension:

[source, xml,indent=0]
.${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/extensions.xml
----
include::../functional-tests/test-bed/src/main/resources/extensions.xml[]
