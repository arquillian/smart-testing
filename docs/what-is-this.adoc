== What is this?

*Smart Testing* is a tool that speeds up the test running phase by reordering test execution plan to increase a probability of
fail-fast execution and thus give you faster feedback about your project's health.

Suppose that you need to implement a new feature in your current project.
If you are following _TDD_ / _BDD_ approach, you'll write some test(s) to validate that the new feature behaves as expected.
Then you'll implement the new feature and when you get that all tests passes. Last step is to push this code to your source
control, which probably will trigger a new build in your CI server running all the tests.

And at this point two things can happen:

. The build takes several minutes and it does not fail.
. The build takes several minutes but it fails because your new tests are failing (yes I know it worked in your machine).

Usually you don't have that much influence on when your new tests are going to be executed.
They could be the first ones, in that case your build will fail fast, or they might be the last ones, so you'll need to
wait some time until you get the failure.

*Smart testing* project aims to solve this uncertainty by ordering tests so that the first tests that could fail (because for example they
are new or because failed previously) are going to be executed first.


=== Technical Details

Currently Smart Testing supports Maven through Maven Extension mechanism and works together with `maven-surefire-plugin`
and `maven-failsafe-plugin`.

=== Minimum requirements

Java:: Requires Java 8. In case of using <<Affected>> strategy, Java 9 is not supported yet.

Maven:: Tested with Maven `3.3.9` and `3.5.0` but any version above `3.1.X` should work. Our recommendation is that you
use at least `3.3.X` version to avoid any extension API problems.

Surefire/Failsafe:: Minimum version required is `2.19.1` or above. It is important to make sure that you have it defined
in your `pom.xml`, as Maven comes with the default version which might not be compatible with our extension.
