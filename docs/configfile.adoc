== Configuration File

You can use smart-testing `YAML` file at `${project.dir}/smart-testing.yml` or at `${project.dir}/smart-testing.yaml`.

Configuration file looks as follows:

[[config-file]]
[source, yaml, indent=0]
----
include::../core/src/test/resources/configuration/smart-testing.yml[]
----
copyToClipboard:config-file[]

<1> This defines mode to be used by Smart Testing.
<2> This defines strategies to be used while finding important tests.
<3> This defines plugin to be used for Smart Testing.
<4> This enables debug logs for Smart Testing.
<5> This disables Smart Testing if set to true.
<6> This enables Smart Testing report if set to true.
<7> This sets first commit sha or `HEAD` notation for inspecting changes.
<8> This sets last commit sha or `HEAD` notation for inspecting changes.
<9> This defines if smart testing should auto correct misspelled strategies.
<10> This defines the pair key/value of custom strategies as list.
<11> This defines list of strategy related configurations that you want to apply while applying strategy.
<12> This enables transitivity.
<13> This defines list of packages to be excluded while applying transitivity.
<14> This defines list of packages to be included while applying transitivity.

All parameters in configuration file are optional. If you haven't used any parameter in configuration file, Smart testing will use default value for that parameter.
You can look at <<_reference_card, references>> for default value of parameter.

However you can overwrite all configuration options using system properties supported by Smart Testing.
You can look <<_reference_card, references>> for all supported system properties.

=== Configuration File Reference
The `const:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/configuration/ConfigurationLoader.java[name="SMART_TESTING_YML"]` file is a `YAML` file defining required configuration to configure Smart Testing.

NOTE: You can use either a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension for this file.

|Field | Description

a| strategies
a| This is used to define required strategies to find important tests. Look at <<_strategies, strategies>> for all supported options.

a| mode
a| This is used to select mode for Smart Testing. Look at <<_modes, modes>> for all supported options & default value.

a| applyTo
a| This applies smart testing to use with `surefire` or `failsafe` plugin definition.

a| debug
a| This option runs smart testing in debug mode.

a| disable
a| This disables smart testing extension without removing it.

a| report
a| This configures report options for smart testing. Look at <<_report_options, Report Options>> for all available options.

a| scm
a| To run Smart Testing with `SCM` configuration. You can either define `range` or `lastChanges`. Look at <<_scm_options, Scm Options>>
   for all available options.

a| autocorrect
a| This configures Smart Testing to auto correct misspelled strategies to the closest one. For example in case of user set strategies to `nwe`, if `autocorrect` is enabled then it is automatically changed to `new`.

a| customStrategies
a| A list of custom strategies in the form of key/value. It is important to notice that the _key_ part must be prefixed with `const:core/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/configuration/Configuration.java[name="SMART_TESTING_CUSTOM_STRATEGIES"].`.
