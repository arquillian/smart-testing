== Usage

=== Examples

After <<Installation, installing>> *Smart Testing Maven Extension* you can use any goal you use with `maven-surefire-plugin`
or `maven-failsafe-plugin`.

To configure it you only need to pass from CLI the Java system properties.
Let's see some examples:

*You want to run only tests that you've just added or modified locally*

`$ mvn clean test -Dsmart.testing.mode=selecting -Dsmart.testing="new, changed"`

*You want to run all tests but given priority to the latest tests added or modified*

`$ mvn clean test -Dsmart.testing.mode=ordering -Dscm.last.changes=1 -Dsmart.testing="new, changed"`

TIP: `smart.testing.mode` is not mandatory in case of `ordering` because it is the **default** mode.

*You want to run only tests that validates new or modified business classes locally*

`$ mvn clean test -Dsmart.testing.mode=selecting -Dsmart.testing="affected"`

When you are running Smart Testing, you'll see following logs in the console, showing your current configuration:

----
INFO: Smart-Testing - Applied strategies: [new, affected]
INFO: Smart-Testing - Applied usage: [selecting]
----

This can be used as feedback to check that the extension has been installed correctly.

=== Disabling Smart Testing

Sometimes you might want to disable smart testing extension without removing it.

To do it you just need to set `smart.testing.disable` Java system property to `true` and then tests will
run with standard `surefire` / `failsafe` plugins.

=== Plugin Selection

*Smart testing* extension hooks into `surefire` and `failsafe` lifecycle to provide the order/selection of tests to execute.

If you only want to use smart testing on `surefire` or `failsafe` plugin definition.

To do it you just need to set `smart.testing.apply.to` with either `surefire` or `failsafe` to just enable in one of them.
