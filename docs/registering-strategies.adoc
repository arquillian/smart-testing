== Registering Custom Strategies

By default *Smart Testing* comes with a set of strategies such as `new`, `changed`, `affected` or `failed`, but you can implement your own strategies and registering them.

To do it you just need to follow next four steps:

* Implement `org.arquillian.smart.testing.spi.TestExecutionPlannerFactory` Java SPI and registering as such.
* Implement `org.arquillian.smart.testing.spi.TestExecutionPlanner` interface.
* Register strategy on Smart Testing configuration file (optional).

=== Implementing `TestExecutionPlannerFactory`

`TestExecutionPlannerFactory` is a Java SPI interface that manages the creation of the strategy.
You need to implement three simple methods, two related with the name of the strategy and one that generates the strategy class.

As an example from `failed` strategy:

[source, java]
.FailedTestsDetectorFactory.java
----
include::../strategies/failed/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/strategies/failed/FailedTestsDetectorFactory.java[tag=documentation]
----
<1> Returns the alias of the strategy
<2> Returns an instance of `TestExecutionPlanner`

Of course as any other Java SPI, you need to register it in `META-INF/services`.

[source, properties]
.META-INF/services/org.arquillian.smart.testing.spi.TestExecutionPlannerFactory
----
include::../strategies/failed/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.arquillian.smart.testing.spi.TestExecutionPlannerFactory[]
----

=== Implementing `TestExecutionPlanner`

`TestExecutionPlanner` is the strategy implementation of the strategy.
The important method there is `getTests()` which returns a collection of the tests that must be executed.
You also need to set there the strategy name.

For example, failed strategy is implemented as:

[source, java]
.FailedTestsDetector.java
----
include::../strategies/failed/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/strategies/failed/FailedTestsDetector.java[tag=documentation]
----
<1> Method that returns list of tests to execute
<2> `TestSelection` requires fully qualified test class name and the strategy where is calculated

==== `ChangeStorage`, `ChangeResolver` and `TestResultParser`

*Smart Testing* provides some services to get some common operations.
These services can be used to get information from current project.

===== `ChangeStorage`

Change Storage service is used to get the changes (from SCM perspective) that has occurred in current project.
This service does not read changes from SCM directly but from a file that has precalculated all changes at the beginning of the Smart Testing process.

Notice that in this way your strategy is more performant since, code does not need to calculate changes for each strategy.

To get it you just need to call `new JavaSPILoader().onlyOne(ChangeStorage.class).get()`.

===== `ChangeResolver`

Change Resolver service is like <<ChangeStorage>> but in this case the changes are calculated directly from SCM.

To get it you just need to call `new JavaSPILoader().onlyOne(ChangeResolver.class).get()`.

This service is usually not used directly in strategies since we recommend using <<ChangeStorage>> service for this purposes and just fall back to this service in case of error.

For example:

[source, java]
----
include::../strategies/changed/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/vcs/git/ChangedTestsDetector.java[indent=0, tag=read_changes]
----
<1> Changes are read from precalculated file
<2> Fallback to calculate directly from SCM

===== `TestResultParser`

Test Result Parser is a service that reads previous test results.
Currently it behaves like a parser for `surefire` report file.

To use it you just need to call `new JavaSPILoader().onlyOne(TestResultParser.class).get()`.

=== Registering strategy

Finally you need to register strategy in Smart Testing configuration file where you set the strategy name as key and the Maven coordinates as value.
This file is required so *Smart Testing* can automatically register the artifacts in build tool script.

As an example of registering previous strategy:

[source, yml]
.smart-testing.yml
----
customStrategies:
    - smart.testing.strategy.failed=org.arquillian.smart.testing:strategy-failed:1.0.0
----

It is important to notice that the _key_ part must be prefixed with `const:mvn-extension/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/mvn/ext/dependencies/StrategyDependencyResolver.java[name="SMART_TESTING_STRATEGY_PREFIX"]`.


=== Alternative Approach

You can still use another approach to register the pair _strategy name_:_Maven coordinates without configuring them in Smart Testing configuration file and it is using a System property.

For example <<custom-strategy, previous example>> would be equivalent as running *Smart Testing* with next System property:

`-Dsmart.testing.strategy.failed=org.arquillian.smart.testing:strategy-failed:1.0.0`

Notice again that it must be prefixed with `const:mvn-extension/src/main/java/org/arquillian/smart/testing/mvn/ext/dependencies/StrategyDependencyResolver.java[name="SMART_TESTING_STRATEGY_PREFIX"]`.
