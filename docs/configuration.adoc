== Configuration

=== Modes

So far in <<What is this?>> section we explained that *Smart testing* changes the order of test execution plan
to run first the important tests and then the rest. This is know as `ordering` mode, but that's not the only one.

`ordering`:: `ordering` mode as its name suggests orders the test execution plan so important tests are executed first
and then the rest.

`selecting`:: `selecting` mode just selects the important tests and execute them, skipping the rest of the tests. This is the default mode.

In order to define the mode use `smart.testing.mode` Java system property with either one.

=== Strategies

Until now, you've read that smart testing is changing test execution plan running or only including important tests.
But how do we know which tests are important and which ones not?

There are several strategies that you can choose from which determine what are the *important* tests.
Currently we have following strategies in place: `new`, `changed`, `affected` and `failed`.

To set them you need to set Java system property `smart.testing` to one or more strategies in comma-separated value form.

Subsequent sections dive deeper into each and every one of them.

==== New

`New` strategy uses _SCM_ information (currently only _Git_ is supported) to detect *new* tests and treat them as *important*
tests to run them first (_ordering_) or filtered (_selecting_).

So internally this strategy inspects your _SCM_ history (and local changes) and all tests that were added (so they are effectively new)
are marked as important ones.

This strategy can be configured in several ways through Java system properties:

* `scm.range.head` and `scm.range.tail` are used to set the range of commits you want to inspect for new tests.
The values can be commit ids or using `HEAD` notation.
For example: `-Dscm.range.head=HEAD -Dscm.range.tail=HEAD~`
By default if not specified, default value is `HEAD`.
* `scm.last.changes` can be used to set the number of commits from `HEAD` that you want to inspect.
For example `-Dscm.last.changes=3` will be equivalent as `-Dscm.range.head=HEAD -Dscm.range.tail=HEAD~~`.

TIP: Those properties might be in particular handy when used in the CI builds.
For example in Jenkins when using https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin[Git Plugin] you can configure your build as follows:
`$ mvn clean verify -Dsmart.testing=new, affected -Dscm.range.head=GIT_COMMIT -Dscm.range.tail=GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT`

Currently not committed changes (those that are _added_ and _untracked_) are considered as important tests as well.
This effectively means that if you don't specify any commit range, only these information is considered.

==== Changed

`Changed` strategy is like <<New>> strategy, but it uses only tests that are *modified* (they were already committed in the past)
instead of *new* ones.

In this strategy not committed changes (those that are _modified_ or _changed_) are considered as important tests as well.

TIP: Usually `new` and `changed` strategies are used together `-Dsmart.testing=new, changed`.

==== Affected

`Affected` strategy uses a different approach to choose what are the *important* tests to run first (_ordering_) or filtered (_selecting_).
This strategy also relies on _SCM_ information but in this case it retrieves any *new* or *modified* business class
between commits range and local changes as well.

TIP: `scm.range.head`, `scm.range.tail` and `scm.last.changes` Java system properties are valid as well.

When this strategy gets all changes then inspect all tests of current project checking which ones _imports_ these classes.
If the test exercises a business class that has been modified, we treat it as *important*  so it will be executed earlier in the test plan.

.About transitivity
****
Our approach does not find only direct test classes related to the business code which was changed, but takes into an account transitivity. This means that any import of a business class is considered as a dependency of the test too.

Suppose we have `ATest.java` which imports `A.java`.
At the same time `A.java` imports `B.java` (ATest -> A -> B).
If `B.java` is modified, then `ATest.java` is considered an *important* test too.

By default this import transitivity is applied to all imports except the ones from `java`.

Sometimes you might want to stop this transitivity before reaching these imports, for example in case of developing an application with any third-party library, you'd probably want to *exclude* its imports.
Or maybe just *include* imports from your business code, for example all imports from `org.superbiz`.

*Affected* provides two ways to provide _inclusions_ and _exclusions_:

inclusions/exclusions system proeprty:: you can set inclusions and/or exclusions by using `smart.testing.affected.inclusions`/`smart.testing.affected.exclusions` which accepts comma-separated values.
For example: `-Dsmart.testing.affected.inclusions=org.mysuperbiz.*`.

config properties file:: you can create a properties file containing inclusions and/or exclusions and set its location using `smart.testing.affected.config` system property.
For example `-Dsmart.testing.affected.config=affected-configuration.properties`

.affected-configuration.properties
----
inclusions=org.mysuperbiz.*
exclusions=org.springframework.*, org.apache.commons.*
----

IMPORTANT: Exclusions has precedence over inclusions.

****

IMPORTANT: This strategy is currently only applicable for _white box_ testing approach. At this point our approach is to
 analyze direct code dependencies, but we are working on broader use cases.

WARNING: At this moment, this strategy does not work with Java 9.

==== Failed

`Failed` strategy just gets all tests that failed from previous executions and mark them as *important* tests to run first (_ordering_) or not filtered (_selecting_).

This strategy uses the _JUnit_ XML _de-facto_ https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire/blob/master/maven-surefire-plugin/src/site/resources/xsd/surefire-test-report.xsd[report] for reading past executions. All reports are automatically copied by the maven extension to a temp directory `${project.directory}/.reports` and when the build is finished the directory is removed.
